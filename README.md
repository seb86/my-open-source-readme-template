## 🔔 Overview

Explain an overview on what {Project Title} is for and what it can do.


### 😄 Is This Free?

Yes, it's free. But here's what you should _really_ care about:

* The code adheres to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards) and follows best practices and conventions.

<!-- List other good things about this project. -->


### ❓ What's the Catch?

<!-- The project may or may not need further development only maintenance. -->

This is a non-commercial plugin. As such:

* Development time for it is effectively being donated and is therefore, limited.
* Support inquiries may not be answered in a timely manner.
* Critical issues may not be resolved promptly.

If you:

* have a customization/integration requirement, or
* want to see another feature added, e.g. support for **eggs** or **donuts**,

...then I'd love to [hear from you](https://sebastiendumont.com/about/)!

Please understand that this repository is not a place to seek help with configuration-related issues. Use it to report bugs, propose improvements, or discuss new features.
