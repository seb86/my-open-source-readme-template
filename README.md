## üîî Overview

Explain an overview on what {Project Title} is for and what it can do.


### üòÑ Is This Free?

Yes, it's free. But here's what you should _really_ care about:

* The code adheres to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards) and follows best practices and conventions.

<!-- List other good things about this project. -->


### ‚ùì What's the Catch?

<!-- The project may or may not need further development only maintenance. -->

This is a non-commercial plugin. As such:

* Development time for it is effectively being donated and is therefore, limited.
* Support inquiries may not be answered in a timely manner.
* Critical issues may not be resolved promptly.

If you:

* have a customization/integration requirement, or
* want to see another feature added, e.g. support for **eggs** or **donuts**,

...then I'd love to [hear from you](https://sebastiendumont.com/about/)!

Please understand that this repository is not a place to seek help with configuration-related issues. Use it to report bugs, propose improvements, or discuss new features.

## ‚≠ê Support

{Project Title} is released freely and openly. Feedback or ideas and approaches to solving limitations in {Project Title} is greatly appreciated.

<!--
Uncomment this if the project is a WooCommerce extension.

{Project Title} is not supported via the [WooCommerce Helpdesk](http://woocommerce.com/). As the extension is not sold via Woocommerce.com, the support team at WooCommerce.com is not familiar with it and may not be able to assist.
-->

At present I **do not offer a dedicated, premium support channel** for {Project Title}. Please understand this is a non-commercial {project/plugin/extension}. As such:

* Development time for it is effectively being donated and is therefore, limited.
* Support inquiries may not be answered in a timely manner.
* Critical issues may not be resolved promptly.
